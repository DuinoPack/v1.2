	under the LGPL, in order to be compiled with the Arduino libraries and still hold compatibility	between
	both licenses.
	But this does not affects the SNAPI original license in any way, and DOES NOT AUTHORIZES ANY THIRD PARTY
	TO USE OR REDISTRIBUTE THE SNAPI LIBRARY UNDER THE LGPL. In other words: This exception ONLY AFFECTS the
	library when compiled with Arduino libraries, if and only if, this license (the MPL) results in some
	inconpatibility with the LGPL (so in this last case, then LGPL applies):

    Any way, we strongly believe in peace, so we would not like to see our work in any non-civil or military
    project. But, due to the possible incompatibilty with the LGPL licenses, this may be only a recommendation
    and an expression of our wishes. But, if some clever guy can determine that LGPL and MPL are compatible
