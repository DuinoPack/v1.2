To make it possible to have different versions of binutils packages
installed for diffrent targets the locale and most common documentation have
been removed from the cross packages. If you want these files aswell you'll
have to install the same version of the native package as of this package.

For nesC/TinyOS users, the addition of "OPTFLAGS:= -Wa,--allow-dollars" 
to their makefiles will allow the use of dollars in function  names (with 
nesC >=1.1.3).
